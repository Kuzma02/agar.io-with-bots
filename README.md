# Project Description

This project is a clone of the popular online multiplayer game, Agar.io, developed using Vanilla JavaScript. It's a lightweight, browser-based game where players control a cell in a petri dish-like environment. The objective is to grow in size by consuming smaller cells while avoiding being consumed by larger ones. This version introduces a dark mode for an eye-friendly gaming experience and enables players to compete against computer-controlled cells.

# Key Features:

- Dark Mode: A sleek dark theme that reduces eye strain, especially in low-light conditions, enhancing the visual comfort for players.

- Single Player Mode: Players can enjoy the game solo by competing against computer-controlled cells, offering a challenging and engaging experience.

- Dynamic Cell Movements: Smooth and responsive cell movements, ensuring an immersive and interactive gameplay experience.

# Technologies Used:

- Core Technology: Vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing the use of fundamental programming skills without the reliance on external libraries or frameworks.

- HTML5 and CSS3: For structuring and styling the game's user interface, ensuring a modern and user-friendly design.

# Game Mechanics:

- Growth Algorithm: Cells grow in size as they consume smaller cells, with the growth rate decreasing progressively to balance the gameplay.

- Collision Detection: Accurate detection of interactions between player cells and other cells in the game environment.

# Conclusion

This Agar.io clone is a testament to the power and flexibility of Vanilla JavaScript in creating engaging, interactive web applications. By incorporating dark mode and AI opponents, this project offers a fresh take on the classic Agar.io game, making it accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of players.
